# Filtering Exercises for Robotics

This repository contains three assignments focused on implementing various filtering algorithms for robot localization. Each assignment builds upon the previous one, introducing increasingly sophisticated approaches to state estimation.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Discrete Bayes Filter
- Implementation of a basic Bayes filter for discrete state estimation
- Grid world environment with discrete states
- Forward movements and turns
- Beam sensor measurements
- Directory: `filtering_exercises/assignment1_bayes/`

### Assignment 2: Extended Kalman Filter
- Implementation of EKF for continuous state estimation
- Continuous world environment
- Nonlinear motion and measurement models
- Range-bearing measurements to landmarks
- Directory: `filtering_exercises/assignment2_ekf/`

### Assignment 3: Particle Filter
- Implementation of particle filter for non-Gaussian estimation
- Multimodal world environment
- Complex dynamics and noise models
- Weighted particle representation
- Directory: `filtering_exercises/assignment3_particle/`

## Features

### Environments
- Grid World: Discrete state space for Bayes filter
- Continuous World: Continuous state space for EKF
- MultiModal World: Complex environment for particle filter

### Visualization Tools
- Real-time belief state visualization
- Trajectory plotting
- Uncertainty visualization
- Performance analysis tools

## Installation

Each assignment has its own dependencies. Install the one you're working on:

```bash
# For Assignment 1: Bayes Filter
pip install -e ".[assignment1]"

# For Assignment 2: Extended Kalman Filter
pip install -e ".[assignment2]"

# For Assignment 3: Particle Filter
pip install -e ".[assignment3]"
```
